<h2>Getting Started</h2>
* Create an account <strong>or</strong> login to ensure your songs get saved to the global catalog.
* If you want to just experiment, simply click "make songs" to get started fast.
* If you'd rather just check out the global catalog and listen to soothing tunes, click "view songs" to proceed.

<h2>Composing a Song</h2>
* To build a basic 4 chord song structure, grab a chord by clicking and dragging it into the chosen chords field below. 

* Before dragging your first chord in, the view only displays available chords. After you drag your first chord in, available key signatures will populate at the top, followed by available notes, and then the remaining chords that are available to choose. As you drag, the key signatures will begin to filter down. This will also filter your remaining chord choices to ensure you remain within a recognized key signature.

* Once you have your chords in place, you may hit "Play" to listen to the song. To rearrange a chord, you can swap it with any other chord in your song by clicking and dragging that chord to the chord you want to swap with.
* To test out a melody with your song, hit the play arrow again and either click on the grey notes or press a valid keyboard key beginning with 'a' and continuing down the line (ex: a, s, d, f, ...).

* Once you are ready to record your song, click the red record circle button, hit the play arrow, and then play your notes as the song chords play out.

<h2>Save your Song</h2>
<em>Note: you must be logged in to save a song</em>

* Once you are satisfied with a recording, you may click the "save song" button to enter in the name of your masterpiece! 

* After you submit the name, you may now view your song in the global catalog by clicking on the "view songs" button.
